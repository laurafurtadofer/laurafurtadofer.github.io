    "text": "This plot shows that couple age gaps have remained pretty consistent over time and that the data was skewed towards more recent movies. It also shows that there are many more non-same gender couples than same gender couples in Hollywood movies but that the same gender couples are equally spread out along the age gap axis. Same gender couples only appeared in this Hollywood data set after the year 2000.\nCitations:\nThis data comes from Hollywood Age Gap via Data Is Plural.\nData Science Learning Community (2024).

The few differences are in the purchase of jewelry and greeting cards. The proportion of jewelry purchased compared to other items declines after people turn 44 and the proportion of greeting cards purchased picks up at age 35+.\nCitations:\nThis data comes from The National Retail Federation in the United States’ Valentine’s Day Data Center, specifically the Valentine’s Day survey data.\nData Science Learning Community (2024).
